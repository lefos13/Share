Register Flow Changes

1. When the user tries to register, the client calls the api /passotp, which generates
   and sends the otp to the user so he can verify his email

2. When the user pass the test and give the right otp, then the client should call the api /register in which the final registration happens.

3. The api /verify isnt usefull anymore so the client SHOULD NOT call it anywhere because the /register api knows that the user is already verified by the front-end. Thus when the row is created in the database the column "verified" is true by default.
